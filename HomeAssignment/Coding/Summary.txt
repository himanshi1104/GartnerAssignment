1. What would you have done differently if you had had more time?
If I had more time I would have implemented IOC for which DataAccessLayer 
i.e. for SQL or MongoDB because in future switching back would have been easy and
I would have tried performing Functional Testing if were given more time.

2. Was it your first time writing a unit test, using a particular framework, etc?
Yes, It was first time that I performed Unit Testing in MSTest framework.

3. How to execute?
Design and UnitTestCases can be executed on Visual Studio.
MSTest Framework is used for Unit Testing.
